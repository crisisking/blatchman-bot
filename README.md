Blatchman Markov Chain Chatterbot
=================================

This incredibly simple Javascript IRC chatterbot is powered by Node.js. It mostly spits out gibberish, but it can be pretty funny from time to time.

Usage
-----

1. Fork
2. Edit
3. Run "node driver.js"

I plan on making the bot more configurable in the future.

IRC Library
-----------

The IRC library is also a work in progress. Right now, it supports joining a server, joining and parting channels, auto PING/PONG support, and messaging. It doesn't keep track of much at the moment.
